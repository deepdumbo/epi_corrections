# epi_corrections
Python script for pipeline implementation for correction of magnetic susceptibility induced (geometric and intensity) artefacts from off-resonance field in EPI MRI images. Using existing libraries, such as FSL topup and EPIC.

The methods make use of the different distortions in Echo Planar Images (EPI) depending on direction of phase encoding in the k-space EPI encoding (positive/blip-up and negative blip-down phase encoding).

For a correction of a pair of EPI images (blip-up, blip-down), the different type of distortion based on phase encoding directions are used to to make an off-resonance field.

The off-resonance field is then used to "unwrap" each EPI image in the pair, aiming the two to be identical.
